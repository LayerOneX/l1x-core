## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker v20.10.x or higher
- Docker Compose v2.x.x
- Git
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 50GB available disk space


### Database Setup

L1X Core uses PostgreSQL as its primary database system for storing blockchain data and maintaining node state.

Using Docker and Docker Compose:

The default database credentials are:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

These credentials are configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file. For production environments, it's recommended to:
1. Change these default credentials
2. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system
3. Never commit production credentials to version control

The database configuration file `l1x_core_db.conf` includes the following default settings:
- Port: 5433
- Maximum connections: 100

These settings can be adjusted based on your deployment requirements and hardware specifications.

### Building from Source

Using Docker and Docker Compose:

```
chmod +x ./run_l1x_core_node.sh
chmod +x ./docker-compose-entrypoint.sh
```

```
docker build -f Dockerfile-build -t l1x-v2-compiler .
```

## Usage

### Configuring the Node

- Copy the `config.toml.example` file to `config.toml`
- Update the `config.toml` file with your desired settings

```
cp config.toml.example config.toml
```

More details about the `config.toml` file can be found in the [config.toml.example](config.toml.example) file.

### Running a Full Node

Using Docker and Docker Compose:

```
./docker-compose-entrypoint.sh
```
